Final project repository for cs171 - Missing Pieces: Understanding Overdoses Beyond the Statistics

## Description

An interactive scrolling website that explores overdose data beyond the statistics, using a smooth section-based navigation system.

## How to Run

Since this is currently a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript website with no dependencies, you can run it in several ways:

### Option 1: Open directly in browser
Simply double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.

### Option 2: Use a local server (recommended)
To avoid any potential CORS issues with certain browsers, you can use a local development server:

#### Using Python:
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Then open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`

#### Using Node.js:
If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `http-server` package:
```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

Then open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`
